# Tools for Media-Verification-
This repo provides open-source code for a project I worked on during ETHGlobal Paris Hackathon 2023. The project combines image segmentation AI models with blockchain attestation and other cryptographic tools to offer a solution to media verification and authentication. 

Project Overview

The project aims to address and solve a pressing societal issue - ensuring the authenticity and personhood of digital content in the age of AI.

Although the hackathon focused on blockchain and cryptocurrency. I decided to integrate AI technologies to illustrate the role of crypto in providng the laws of ownership and creative credentialing.

Project Name 

Coral reefs have a very symbiotic relationship. If you look at an illustration of a latent space and an image of a coral reef, youn will find odd similarities between the natual systems and the artificial intellgent systems.
